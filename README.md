# BINGO-Hotel-Price-Prediction
To predict the price of a Hotel is a kind of a tricky job, making prediction easier I have used some of the Machine learning techniques that would examine the Hotel prices.
For each individual or tourist who is moving from one place to another, hotels play a crucial part. If the services are poor, the
bookings of that hotel are low and if the services are awesome then high bookings in that hotel takes place. 
Here we use many popular Machine Learning Algorithms like linear regression model, imported some importand libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, sklearn, pathlib, etc. 

 By ‘HOTEL PRICE PREDICTION’ user can know about the price of Hotels in very early time.
With the help of these predictions of Hotel price user can take decision about the booking of hotel in lesser time.

The Dataset which is used in this project is taken from Kaggle.com. This Dataset contains the details of Hotel name , id , ratings , rooms availability, price, distance, city.
in this project , I have trained and test the data using linear regression model
