# BINGO-Hotel-Price-Prediction

**1.) ABSTRACT**

The main function of hotels is to give visitors a place to stay, food to eat, refreshment to drink, and other such services and commodities. They do this by commercially providing items that are often furnished in homes but not available to those travelling away from home.
To predict the price of a Hotel is a kind of a tricky job, making prediction easier I have used some of the Machine learning techniques that would examine the Hotel prices.
For each individual or tourist who is moving from one place to another, hotels play a crucial part. If the services are poor, the
bookings of that hotel are low and if the services are awesome then high bookings in that hotel takes place. 

Every traveller has their own definition of a good hotel, but most agree that there are six characteristics that define a really memorable stay. These include the environment of the hotel, management, location, pricing, and service.

What we wish to design is a predictive Hotel Price which takes into account various parameters like city, distance, price, rooms availability and ratings.

**2.) INTRODUCTION**

Chilling out on the bed in your hotel room watching television, while wearing your own pyjamas , is sometimes the best part of vacation. Hotel life is about the same in every latitude. Hotels are taking luxury to new levels. Super luxury hotels are being built-in outer space. People think being fanous is so glamorous, but half the time we are in strange room living out of a suitcase. 
In this project, we'll make predictions about hotels with favourable reviews and location which is also near to user's present location.

A Python predictive model predicts a specific future result based on trends discovered through historical data. In essence, you train a model that recognises specific patterns to predict outcomes, such as future sales, disease contraction, fraud, and so forth, by gathering and analysing historical data.
Here we took the dataset from Kaggle.com and used many popular Machine Learning Algorithms like linear regression model on the data sets in order to train the data. Further which we try to predict the values for the untrained data. This is when the predict() function comes into the picture., imported some importand libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, sklearn, pathlib, etc. This Dataset contains the details of Hotel name , id , ratings , rooms availability, price, distance, city.

By ‘HOTEL PRICE PREDICTION’ user can know about the price of Hotels in very early time.
With the help of these predictions of Hotel price user can take decision about the booking of hotel in lesser time. 
The user will choose their current location and look for the nearest hotel from their current location considering price and ratings.

**3.) MOTIVATION**

*“Money doesn’t mean anything to me. I’ve made a lot of money, but I want to enjoy life and not stress myself building my bank account. I give lots away and live simply, mostly out of a suitcase in hotels. We all know that good health is much more important.” ~ Keanu Reeves *

Back then, when it was festival season, my friends and I went on a night trip without making hotel reservations in advance. We mistakenly believed that we would do it once we arrived at our location. We literally didn't get a room at any hotels and were just wandering everywhere.

From that moment, I instantaneously had the idea to create a model that would make it simple for us to locate hotels in our local surroundings.
