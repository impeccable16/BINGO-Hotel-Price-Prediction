# BINGO-Hotel-Price-Prediction

** 1.) ABSTRACT **

The main function of hotels is to give visitors a place to stay, food to eat, refreshment to drink, and other such services and commodities. They do this by commercially providing items that are often furnished in homes but not available to those travelling away from home.
To predict the price of a Hotel is a kind of a tricky job, making prediction easier I have used some of the Machine learning techniques that would examine the Hotel prices.
For each individual or tourist who is moving from one place to another, hotels play a crucial part. If the services are poor, the
bookings of that hotel are low and if the services are awesome then high bookings in that hotel takes place. 

Every traveller has their own definition of a good hotel, but most agree that there are six characteristics that define a really memorable stay. These include the environment of the hotel, management, location, pricing, and service.

What we wish to design is a predictive Hotel Price which takes into account various parameters like city, distance, price, rooms availability and ratings.

2.) INTRODUCTION
Here we use many popular Machine Learning Algorithms like linear regression model, imported some importand libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, sklearn, pathlib, etc. 

 By ‘HOTEL PRICE PREDICTION’ user can know about the price of Hotels in very early time.
With the help of these predictions of Hotel price user can take decision about the booking of hotel in lesser time.

The Dataset which is used in this project is taken from Kaggle.com. This Dataset contains the details of Hotel name , id , ratings , rooms availability, price, distance, city.
in this project , I have trained and test the data using linear regression model
